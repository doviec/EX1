# Ex1
EX1 matala is an assigment that represents three functions; Monom, Polynom and ComplexFunction.
This project allows us to make a varrity of math operations towards these functions. 
In addition we may read a file with a colections of functions and draw them with stddraw in class Functions_GUI.

# Class Monom
In this class we can build a Monom and make operations between two Monom's

# Class Polynom
Polynom is a group of Monoms (may be one as well). This class allowes us to use math operations on Polynom between Polynom and Monom.

# Class ComplexFunction
A ComplexFunction is made by a math Operation and one of the three functions. ComplexFunction also allowes to use math operations between itself and different functions.

# Class Functions_GUI
With this class we can read a file and take its functions and draw them in  a Y and X scales.
